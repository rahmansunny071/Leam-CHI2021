From tweets to product reviews, text is ubiquitous on the web and often contains highly valuable information for both enterprises and consumers. However, online text is generally noisy and incomplete, requiring adequate extensible tools for iterative, integrated text analysis and mining.  While there are systems effective for different stages of text analysis, users lack extensible 
platforms to support interactive text analysis 
workflows end-to-end. Here we introduce \system combining the strengths of spreadsheets, computational notebooks, and interactive visualizations to facilitate integrated text analytics. \system implements a visual text algebra to facilitate extensible and expressive analysis, supporting diverse tasks ranging from data cleaning to visualization. It also enables declarative specification of interactive coordination across views of data, code, and visualizations. We evaluate \system through two case studies using two popular Kaggle text analytics workflows and elicit user feedback. Based on our findings, we discuss the implications and opportunities for integrated text analysis.

% From tweets to online product reviews, digital text on the web is ubiquitous. Text analysis often involves multiple tasks---data wrangling, model building, hypothesis testing, insight extraction---which analysts perform in an iterative, non-linear fashion. While there are many systems like spreadsheets, computational notebooks, and visualization tools to support many of these tasks, there is a lack of an integrated analytics platform to support an entire text analysis workflow. We propose \system that provides a multiple-coordinated interface featuring data, script, and chart views. \system allows analysts to manipulate, model, and analyze text datasets via scripts and GUI-based operators while enabling coordinated data exploration. The analysis and coordination operators are developed based on an existing visual text algebra. We test \system on two case studies with researchers at \company and obtain feedback on the its pros and cons. Based on our findings, we discuss the implications and opportunities for integrated text analysis.

% With the increase in scale and availability of digital text generated on the web, enterprises such as online retailers and aggregators often use text analytics to mine and analyze the data to improve their services and products alike. 
% Text data analysis is an iterative, non-linear process with diverse workflows spanning multiple stages, from data cleaning to visualization. Existing text analytics systems usually accommodate a subset of these stages and often fail to address challenges related to data heterogeneity, provenance, workflow reusability and reproducibility, and compatibility with established practices.  Based on a set of design considerations we derive from these challenges, we propose \system, a system that treats the text analysis process as a single continuum by combining advantages of computational notebooks, spreadsheets, and visualization tools. \system features an interactive user interface for running text analysis workflows, a new data model for managing multiple atomic and composite data types, and an expressive algebra that captures diverse sets of operations representing various stages of text analysis and enables coordination among different components of the system,  including data, code, and visualizations. We report our current progress in \system development while demonstrating its usefulness with usage examples. Finally, we outline a number of enhancements to \system and identify several research directions for developing an interactive visual text analysis system.
